# SPEC.md — Worclaude CLI

## Product Overview

**worclaude** is a CLI tool that scaffolds a comprehensive Claude Code workflow system into any project. It installs agents, skills, slash commands, hooks, permissions, and configuration files derived from tips by Boris Cherny (creator of Claude Code at Anthropic).

**Version:** 2.1.0
**Install:** `npm install -g worclaude`
**Usage:** `worclaude init` in any project directory

## Three Scenarios

### Scenario A: Fresh Project

No `.claude/` directory or `CLAUDE.md` exists. Full interactive scaffold.

### Scenario B: Existing Project

Project has some Claude Code setup (CLAUDE.md, skills, hooks, etc.). Smart merge with backup.

### Scenario C: Upgrade

Project previously ran `worclaude init`. Update universal components without touching customizations.

**Detection logic:**

- No `.claude/` and no `CLAUDE.md` → Scenario A
- `.claude/` or `CLAUDE.md` exists but no `.claude/workflow-meta.json` → Scenario B
- `.claude/workflow-meta.json` exists → Scenario C

---

## Init Flow (Scenario A — Fresh Project)

### Step 1: Welcome & Project Info

```
$ worclaude init

  Worclaude v1.2.8
  ─────────────────────

? Project name: My Project
? One-line description: A web app for managing tasks
```

### Step 2: Project Type Selection

Multi-select with inline descriptions and smart redundancy detection.

```
? What type of project is this? (space to toggle, enter to confirm)
  ◻ Full-stack web application — Frontend + backend in one repo
  ◻ Backend / API              — Server, REST/GraphQL, no frontend
  ◻ Frontend / UI              — Client-side app, no backend
  ◻ CLI tool                   — Command-line application
  ◻ Data / ML / AI             — Data pipelines, ML models, LLM apps
  ◻ Library / Package          — Reusable module published to npm/PyPI
  ◻ DevOps / Infrastructure    — Infrastructure, CI/CD, deployment

  ℹ Not sure? Pick what's closest. You can add or remove
    agents later with `worclaude upgrade`.
```

If "Full-stack web" AND "Backend / API" or "Frontend / UI" are selected:

```
  ⚠ "Full-stack web" already includes backend and frontend.
    You may not need to select those separately.
```

If multiple types selected that share recommended agents:

```
  ℹ Some agents are recommended by multiple project types: api-designer, bug-fixer
    They will only be installed once.
```

### Step 3: Tech Stack Selection

Multi-select languages. Determines permissions, hooks (formatter), and template content.

```
? Primary language(s) / runtime: (space to toggle, enter to confirm)
  ◻ Python
  ◻ Node.js / TypeScript
  ◻ Java
  ◻ C# / .NET
  ◻ C / C++
  ◻ Go
  ◻ PHP
  ◻ Ruby
  ◻ Kotlin
  ◻ Swift
  ◻ Rust
  ◻ Dart / Flutter
  ◻ Scala
  ◻ Elixir
  ◻ Zig
  ◻ Other / None

  ℹ This sets tool permissions and formatters.
    Update anytime via settings.json.

? Do you use Docker currently?
  ❯ Yes
    No
  ℹ If you add Docker later, run `worclaude upgrade`.
```

When multiple languages selected, all permissions are merged and formatters are chained with `&&`.

### Step 4: Agent Selection

Two-step category-based approach. Universal agents listed as already included.

**Step 1: Select agent categories (pre-selected based on project type)**

```
✓ Universal agents (always installed):
  ✓ plan-reviewer
  ✓ code-simplifier
  ✓ test-writer
  ✓ build-validator
  ✓ verify-app

? Which agent categories do you need? (space to toggle)
  ◼ Backend         — api-designer, database-analyst, auth-auditor
  ◻ Frontend        — ui-reviewer, style-enforcer
  ◻ DevOps          — ci-fixer, docker-helper, deploy-validator, dependency-manager
  ◼ Quality         — bug-fixer, security-reviewer, performance-auditor, refactorer
  ◻ Documentation   — doc-writer, changelog-generator
  ◻ Data / AI       — data-pipeline-reviewer, ml-experiment-tracker, prompt-engineer
```

**Step 2: Fine-tune each selected category (press Enter to accept all defaults)**

```
? Fine-tune Backend agents? (space to toggle, enter to accept defaults)
  ◼ api-designer       — Reviews API design for RESTful conventions
  ◼ database-analyst    — Reviews database schemas and queries
  ◼ auth-auditor        — Audits authentication and authorization
```

### Step 4.5: Confirmation

After all prompts, before scaffolding, show a review summary.

```
  ─── Review Your Selections ───

  Project:    My Project — A web app for managing tasks
  Type:       Backend / API
  Stack:      Python, Docker
  Agents:     5 universal + 6 optional (11 total)

? Everything look right?
  ◉ Yes, install the workflow
  ○ No, let me start over
  ○ Let me adjust a specific step
```

If "adjust a specific step", show step picker and re-run that step only.

### Step 5: Scaffold

Create all files. Show progress.

```
  Creating workflow structure...

  ✓ CLAUDE.md
  ✓ .claude/settings.json (permissions, hooks, sandbox)
  ✓ .claude/workflow-meta.json
  ✓ .claude/agents/ (5 universal + 6 selected)
  ✓ .claude/commands/ (16 universal)
  ✓ .claude/skills/ (11 universal + 3 templates + 1 generated)
  ✓ .mcp.json
  ✓ docs/spec/PROGRESS.md
  ✓ docs/spec/SPEC.md

  Done! Workflow installed successfully.

  Next steps:
  1. Fill in your Tech Stack and Commands in CLAUDE.md
  2. Fill in project-specific skill templates in .claude/skills/
  3. Write your SPEC.md
  4. Start a Claude Code session: claude --worktree --tmux
```

---

## Init Flow (Scenario B — Existing Project)

### Step 1: Detection & Backup

```
$ worclaude init

  Worclaude v1.2.8
  ─────────────────────

  Detected existing Claude Code setup:

  CLAUDE.md ................. exists (38 lines)
  .claude/settings.json ..... exists
  .claude/skills/ ........... 9 files found
  .claude/agents/ ........... not found
  .claude/commands/ ......... not found
  .mcp.json ................. exists

  A backup will be created before any changes.

? Proceed? (Y/n)
```

### Step 2: Backup

```
  Creating backup...
  ✓ Backed up to .claude-backup-20260323-143022/
```

### Step 3: Project Type & Tech Stack & Agents

Same interactive prompts as Scenario A.

### Step 4: Tiered Merge

**Tier 1 — Additive (automatic, no prompt):**

- Missing skills → add
- Missing agents → add (universal + selected optional)
- Missing commands → add all 12
- settings.json permissions → append new ones to existing list
- settings.json hooks → append new hooks (only if matcher doesn't conflict)
- .mcp.json → add missing servers
- docs/spec/PROGRESS.md → create if missing, skip if exists
- docs/spec/SPEC.md → create if missing, skip if exists
- .claude/workflow-meta.json → create

**Tier 2 — Safe alongside (notify, don't ask):**

- Conflicting skills → keep user's, save workflow version as `{name}.workflow-ref.md`
- Conflicting agents → same pattern
- Conflicting commands → same pattern

**Tier 3 — Interactive (ask user):**

- CLAUDE.md → special handling (see below)
- settings.json hook matcher conflicts → ask user

### Step 5: CLAUDE.md Special Handling

```
  Your CLAUDE.md (38 lines) was detected.

  The workflow recommends these additions:
  [+] Session Protocol section (Start/During/End)
  [+] Critical Rules: self-healing, subagent usage
  [+] Skills pointer section (progressive disclosure)
  [+] Gotchas section (empty, grows during development)

? How would you like to handle CLAUDE.md?
  ◉ Keep mine, save suggestions to CLAUDE.md.workflow-suggestions
  ○ Show me a side-by-side comparison
  ○ Merge interactively section by section
```

Default: keep user's, generate suggestions file.

### Step 6: Report

```
  Merge complete!

  Added:
  ✓ 5 universal agents + 4 selected optional agents
  ✓ 16 slash commands
  ✓ 8 universal skills (3 conflicts saved as .workflow-ref.md)
  ✓ 18 permission rules appended
  ✓ 3 hooks added

  Conflicts (saved alongside):
  ~ context-management.md → context-management.workflow-ref.md
  ~ git-conventions.md → git-conventions.workflow-ref.md
  ~ testing.md → testing.workflow-ref.md

  Suggestions:
  ~ CLAUDE.md.workflow-suggestions (review and merge manually)

  Next steps:
  1. Review .workflow-ref.md files and merge what's useful
  2. Review CLAUDE.md.workflow-suggestions
  3. Delete .workflow-ref.md and .workflow-suggestions files when done
```

---

## Upgrade Flow (Scenario C)

### Step 1: CLI Self-Update Check

Checks the npm registry for a newer CLI version. If found, offers to self-update. On permission errors, suggests `sudo`.

```
$ worclaude upgrade

  ℹ New worclaude version available: v1.2.6 → v1.2.8
? Update worclaude CLI?
  ❯ Yes, update and continue
    No, continue with current version
```

After self-update, re-run is needed (new code must load).

### Step 2: Change Detection

Uses hashes stored in workflow-meta.json to detect which files user has customized.

```
  Changes in 1.1.0:
  + New agent: incident-responder
  + Updated: context-management.md (improved compaction)
  ~ Modified: settings.json (new hook)

  Auto-update (unchanged since install):
    git-conventions.md, plan-reviewer.md, 12 more

  Needs review (you've customized these):
    context-management.md
```

### Step 3: Apply

Same tiered merge as Scenario B for conflicting files. Auto-update unchanged files. Create workflow-meta.json with new version and hashes.

---

## Status Command

Checks the npm registry and shows version status:

- `(up to date)` — workflow and CLI are current
- `(upgrade available: vX.Y.Z)` — workflow is behind CLI, run `worclaude upgrade`
- `(CLI update available: vX.Y.Z)` — newer CLI on npm, run `npm install -g worclaude@latest`
- No suffix when offline (graceful degradation)

```
$ worclaude status

  ▌ WORCLAUDE STATUS
  │ Version    v1.2.8 (up to date)
  │ Project    Backend / API
  │ Stack      Python
  │ Agents     5 universal + 6 optional
  │ Commands   10
  │ Skills     12

  ℹ Customized files (differ from installed version):
        ~ CLAUDE.md

      Hooks:        3 active
  Permissions: 47 rules
```

---

## Backup & Restore

### Backup

```
$ worclaude backup

  Creating backup...
  ✓ Backed up to .claude-backup-20260323-143022/

  Contents:
    CLAUDE.md
    .claude/ (full directory)
    .mcp.json
```

### Restore

```
$ worclaude restore

  Available backups:
  1. .claude-backup-20260323-143022 (2 hours ago)
  2. .claude-backup-20260320-091500 (3 days ago)

? Select backup to restore: 1

  ⚠ This will replace your current Claude setup.
? Confirm restore? (y/N)

  ✓ Restored from .claude-backup-20260323-143022/
```

### Diff

```
$ worclaude diff

  Comparing current setup to workflow v1.2.8:

  Modified (your changes):
  ~ CLAUDE.md (added 5 gotchas)
  ~ .claude/skills/testing.md (added pytest patterns)

  Missing (removed or never installed):
  - .claude/agents/doc-writer.md

  Extra (you added):
  + .claude/skills/my-custom-skill.md
  + .claude/agents/my-custom-agent.md
```

---

## Delete Command

Removes worclaude workflow files from a project. Two modes:

1. **Remove from project** — removes scaffolded files, keeps CLI installed
2. **Remove from project + uninstall hint** — same cleanup, then prints `npm uninstall -g worclaude`

### Safety Rules

- Files tracked in `workflow-meta.json` `fileHashes` with unchanged hash → auto-delete
- Files tracked but user-modified (hash mismatch) → ask user (default: delete, backed up)
- `workflow-meta.json` → always delete (pure worclaude metadata)
- `settings.json` → ask user (may contain user-added permissions/hooks)
- `.workflow-ref.md` / `.workflow-suggestions` files → auto-delete (upgrade artifacts)
- User-added files in `.claude/` (not in `fileHashes`) → never delete
- Claude Code system dirs (`projects/`, `worktrees/`, `todos/`, `memory/`) → never delete
- Root files (`CLAUDE.md`, `.mcp.json`, `docs/spec/*`) → ask user (default: keep)
- `.gitignore` → remove `# Worclaude` header and `.claude/` entry only; keep `.claude-backup-*/`
- Backup directories → never delete

### Flow

```
$ worclaude delete

  ▌ DELETE WORKFLOW

? What would you like to do?
  ❯ Remove workflow from this project
    Remove workflow and uninstall worclaude globally
    ──────
    ← Cancel

  │ Workflow files in .claude/:
  │   ✓ 28 unmodified files (safe to remove)
  │   ~ 3 files you've customized
  │       .claude/agents/plan-reviewer.md
  │       .claude/skills/testing.md
  │       .claude/commands/start.md
  │   ● 2 user-added files (will NOT be touched)

? 3 file(s) have been customized. What should we do?
  ❯ Delete them too (they'll be in the backup)
    Keep them in .claude/

  ℹ These files were created or modified by worclaude but may contain your work:
      .claude/settings.json (permissions & hooks)
      CLAUDE.md
      .mcp.json
      docs/spec/PROGRESS.md
      docs/spec/SPEC.md

? What would you like to do with these files?
  ❯ Keep all (recommended)
    Let me choose which to remove
    Remove all

  ⚠ This will permanently delete 31 file(s).
    A backup will be created first.

? Confirm deletion?
    Yes, delete
  ❯ No, cancel

  ✓ Workflow removed!
    ✓ Removed 28 workflow files from .claude/
    ✓ Cleaned up .gitignore
    ℹ Kept 2 user-added file(s) in .claude/
    ℹ Kept: .claude/settings.json, CLAUDE.md, .mcp.json, docs/spec/PROGRESS.md, docs/spec/SPEC.md
      Backup: .claude-backup-20260327-143052/

  ℹ To uninstall worclaude CLI globally, run:
    npm uninstall -g worclaude
```

### Backup

A backup is always created before any deletion. The backup includes `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.mcp.json`, and `docs/spec/` files.

### Empty Directory Cleanup

After file removal:

- Empty `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/skills/` → removed
- Empty `.claude/` → removed (only if no user files remain)
- Empty `docs/spec/` → removed; empty `docs/` → removed

---

## Doctor Command

Checks installation health across four categories with PASS/WARN/FAIL status per check.

### Core Files

- `workflow-meta.json` — exists with version, projectTypes, techStack
- `CLAUDE.md` — exists and is substantive (min 10 lines); WARN at 30KB, FAIL at 38KB
- `settings.json` — has permissions array and critical hooks (PostCompact, SessionStart)
- `.claude/sessions/` — directory exists for session persistence

### Components

- Universal agents (all 5 present, each has required `description` frontmatter, completeness scoring for optional fields)
- Selected optional agents (per workflow-meta, `description` field verified, completeness scoring)
- Command files (all 16 present)
- Skills (universal + template + agent-routing.md, directory format verified)

### Documentation

- `docs/spec/PROGRESS.md` — exists (required by /start and /sync)
- `docs/spec/SPEC.md` — exists (referenced by plan-reviewer)

### Integrity

- File hash comparison vs `workflow-meta.json` fileHashes — detects customizations or deletions
- Pending `.workflow-ref.md` files — flags unresolved merge conflicts

```
$ worclaude doctor

  ▌ WORCLAUDE DOCTOR
  │
  │ Core Files
  │   ✓ workflow-meta.json
  │   ✓ CLAUDE.md (42 lines)
  │   ✓ settings.json (3 hooks, 47 permissions)
  │   ✓ .claude/sessions/
  │
  │ Components
  │   ✓ 5/5 universal agents
  │   ✓ 6/6 optional agents
  │   ✓ 16/16 commands
  │   ✓ 15/15 skills

  │
  │ Integrity
  │   ✓ 28 files match installed hashes
  │   ⚠ 3 files customized
  │   ✓ No pending review files
  │
  │ Result: HEALTHY (1 warning)
```

---

## Session Persistence

### SessionStart Hook

Fires at the beginning of every Claude Code session. Loads four pieces of context:

1. `CLAUDE.md` — project rules and conventions
2. `docs/spec/PROGRESS.md` — completed work and next steps
3. Most recent `.claude/sessions/*.md` — previous session summary
4. Current git branch name

The SessionStart hook has **no profile gate** — it always fires because losing project context is never acceptable.

### Session Summaries

Written automatically by `/commit-push-pr` (after committing) and `/end` (mid-task handoff). Stored in `.claude/sessions/` with naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-{short-branch-name}.md`.

### Drift Detection

The `/start` command supplements SessionStart with git history drift:

- Extracts session date from the most recent session file
- Counts commits since that date (max 15 one-liners)
- Reports as non-interpreted signals (no warnings or analysis)

---

## Hook Profiles

Set `WORCLAUDE_HOOK_PROFILE` to control which hooks execute:

| Hook                           | minimal | standard (default) | strict |
| ------------------------------ | ------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| SessionStart: Context          | always  | always             | always |
| PostToolUse: Formatter         | skip    | run                | run    |
| PostToolUse: Stop Notification | skip    | run                | run    |
| PostToolUse: TypeScript Check  | skip    | skip               | run    |
| PostCompact: Context           | always  | always             | always |

SessionStart and PostCompact always fire (no profile gate). Formatter and notification hooks gate via shell `case` statement. TypeScript check is strict-only.

```bash
WORCLAUDE_HOOK_PROFILE=minimal claude          # Per-session
export WORCLAUDE_HOOK_PROFILE=strict           # Persistent
```

---

## File Templates

### CLAUDE.md Template

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

{project_name} — {description}

## Key Files

- `docs/spec/PROGRESS.md` — Read first every session
- `docs/spec/SPEC.md` — Source of truth

## Tech Stack

{tech_stack_filled_during_init}

## Commands

{commands_filled_during_init}

## Skills (read on demand, not upfront)

See `.claude/skills/` — load only what's relevant:

- context-management.md — Session lifecycle
- git-conventions.md — Commits and branches
- planning-with-files.md — Implementation planning
- review-and-handoff.md — Session endings
- verification.md — How to verify work
- testing.md — Test philosophy and patterns
  {project_specific_skills}

## Session Protocol

**Start:** Read PROGRESS.md. Read active implementation prompt if any.
**During:** One task at a time. Commit after each. Use subagents for side work.
**End:** Update PROGRESS.md. Write handoff if ending mid-task.

## Critical Rules

1. SPEC.md is source of truth. Do not invent features.
2. Test before moving on.
3. Ask if ambiguous. Do not guess.
4. Read source files before writing. Never assume.
5. Self-healing: same mistake twice → update CLAUDE.md.
6. Use subagents to keep main context clean.
7. Mediocre fix → scrap it, implement elegantly.

## Gotchas

## Universal Agents

### plan-reviewer.md

```markdown
---
name: plan-reviewer
model: opus
isolation: none
---

You are a senior staff engineer reviewing an implementation plan.
Your job is to challenge assumptions, identify ambiguity, check
for missing verification steps, and ensure the plan is specific
enough for one-shot implementation.

Review the plan critically:

- Are there ambiguous requirements that could be interpreted multiple ways?
- Is there a clear verification strategy for each step?
- Are there edge cases not addressed?
- Is the scope realistic for a single implementation pass?
- Does it align with the project's SPEC.md?

Be direct. Flag problems. Suggest improvements. Do not approve
plans that are vague or missing verification steps.
```

### code-simplifier.md

```markdown
---
name: code-simplifier
model: sonnet
isolation: worktree
---

You are a code quality specialist. Review the recently changed
code and improve it:

- Find and eliminate duplication
- Identify reuse opportunities with existing code
- Simplify complex logic
- Ensure consistency with project patterns
- Check CLAUDE.md compliance

Make the changes directly. Run tests after each change to verify
nothing breaks. Commit improvements separately from feature work.
```

### test-writer.md

```markdown
---
name: test-writer
model: sonnet
isolation: worktree
---

You are a test specialist. Write comprehensive tests for the
recently changed code:

- Unit tests for individual functions and methods
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Edge case coverage (null, empty, boundary values)
- Error path testing

Follow the project's testing patterns from .claude/skills/testing.md.
Run all tests to verify they pass. Aim for meaningful coverage,
not 100% line coverage.
```

### build-validator.md

```markdown
---
name: build-validator
model: haiku
isolation: none
---

Validate the project builds and passes all checks:

1. Run the build command
2. Run the full test suite
3. Run the linter
4. Check for type errors (if applicable)

Report any failures with clear error messages. Do not fix
issues — report them so the main session can address them.
```

### verify-app.md

```markdown
---
name: verify-app
model: sonnet
isolation: worktree
---

You are a verification specialist. Test the actual running
application behavior, not just unit tests:

- Start the application
- Test the changed functionality end-to-end
- Verify the behavior matches the specification
- Check for regressions in related features
- Test error handling and edge cases in the running app

Report results with specific pass/fail for each verification step.
```

## Universal Slash Commands

All 16 slash commands are installed in every project. Files live in `.claude/commands/`.

### /start (start.md)

```markdown
Read docs/spec/PROGRESS.md to understand current state.
Read .claude/skills/agent-routing.md for agent usage guidance.

Check for handoff files from previous sessions:

- Look in docs/handoffs/ for any HANDOFF\*.md files
  (both HANDOFF-{branch}-{date}.md and legacy HANDOFF\_{date}.md)
- Prioritize files matching the current branch name
- If found, read them for context and report what was handed off

Drift detection: extract date from most recent .claude/sessions/\*.md,
count commits since that date (max 15), report as non-interpreted signals.

If an active implementation prompt exists, read it.
Report: what was last completed, what's next, any blockers.
```

### /end (end.md)

```markdown
Use this ONLY when stopping work mid-task without committing.

Do NOT update PROGRESS.md — /sync handles that on develop after merging.

Mid-task handoff:

1. Create docs/handoffs/HANDOFF-{branch-name}-{date}.md
2. Include: what was being worked on, what is done, what is left,
   decisions/context needed, files modified
3. git add -A
4. git commit -m "wip: handoff for [task description]"
5. git push
```

### /commit-push-pr (commit-push-pr.md)

```markdown
Determine which branch you're on, then follow the appropriate flow.

On a feature branch (feature/\*, fix/\*, chore/\*, refactor/\*):

- Do NOT touch shared-state files (see git-conventions.md)
- Stage, commit, push, PR targeting develop

On develop (after /sync has been run):

- Stage, commit, push, PR targeting main

On any other branch: ask user which base branch to target.

Use gh pr create for PR creation.
```

### /review-plan (review-plan.md)

```markdown
Send the current implementation plan to the plan-reviewer agent.
The plan-reviewer will act as a staff engineer and critically
review the plan for:

- Ambiguity
- Missing verification steps
- Unrealistic scope
- Edge cases
- SPEC.md alignment

Wait for the review and address all feedback before proceeding.
```

### /techdebt (techdebt.md)

```markdown
Scan the codebase for technical debt:

- Duplicated code
- Dead code (unused functions, imports, variables)
- TODO/FIXME/HACK comments
- Overly complex functions
- Missing tests for critical paths
- Inconsistent patterns

Report findings organized by severity. Fix quick wins directly.
```

### /verify (verify.md)

```markdown
Run full project verification:

1. Run the test suite
2. Run the build
3. Run the linter
4. Run type checking (if applicable)
5. Run any domain-specific verification

Report results clearly. Do not proceed if any check fails.
```

### /compact-safe (compact-safe.md)

```markdown
Run /compact to compress context.
The PostCompact hook will automatically re-read CLAUDE.md
and PROGRESS.md.

After compaction, briefly confirm:

- Current task
- Current branch
- What was just being worked on
```

### /status (status.md)

```markdown
Report current session state:

- Current task / what you're working on
- Git branch and recent commits
- Test status (last run results)
- Context usage estimate
- Any blockers or pending decisions
```

### /update-claude-md (update-claude-md.md)

```markdown
Based on this session's work, propose updates to CLAUDE.md:

Review what happened:

- Any mistakes that should become rules
- Any patterns discovered that should be documented
- Any gotchas encountered

Write the proposed additions to the Gotchas section or
Critical Rules section. Show the diff before applying.
```

### /setup (setup.md)

```markdown
Conversational interview to fill in project-specific files with real content.
Asks 7 sections: Project Story, Architecture, Tech Stack Details, Core Features,
Development Workflow, Coding Conventions, and Verification Strategy.

After the interview, writes/updates: CLAUDE.md, SPEC.md, backend-conventions.md,
frontend-design-system.md, project-patterns.md, and PROGRESS.md with real,
project-specific content from the interview answers.
```

### /sync (sync.md)

```markdown
Update shared-state files after merging feature PRs into develop.
Run on the develop branch AFTER all PRs are merged and conflicts resolved.

Pre-check: confirm on develop, check for conflict markers, check if
anything was merged since last sync (early exit if nothing to do).
Updates: PROGRESS.md (stats, completed items), SPEC.md (if features changed),
version bump per git-conventions.md Versioning Policy.
Verify via /verify. Commit, push, PR to main.
```

### /conflict-resolver (conflict-resolver.md)

```markdown
ONLY resolves merge conflicts — does not update PROGRESS.md, SPEC.md,
or bump versions (that is /sync's job).

1. Detect conflicts via git status
2. Understand each side's intent from git log
3. Resolve: keep both if different areas, combine if same lines, ask if contradictory
4. Verify no conflict markers remain
5. Run tests and lint
6. Commit resolution only — do not push or create PR
```

### /review-changes (review-changes.md)

```markdown
Review changed code for reuse, quality, and efficiency.

CRITICAL: This is a READ-ONLY review. You MUST NOT edit any files.
You MUST NOT make any commits. You MUST NOT stage changes.
Only analyze and report.

1. Read recent changes (git diff HEAD~1 or staged changes)
2. Check for:
   - Duplicated code or missed reuse opportunities
   - Unnecessary complexity or abstraction
   - Inconsistency with project patterns
   - CLAUDE.md compliance issues
3. Report findings as a prioritized table:

| Finding | Category | Action                |
| ------- | -------- | --------------------- |
| [what]  | [type]   | Fix / Skip — [reason] |

The user will decide which findings to act on and apply fixes themselves.
Do NOT apply any fixes. Do NOT touch any files. REPORT ONLY.
```

### /build-fix (build-fix.md)

```markdown
Fix the current build failures. Delegates to the build-fixer agent
for diagnosis and resolution.

Process: Run full validation suite, categorize errors (build → type → test → lint),
fix one category at a time, re-run after each fix, confirm all green.

Rules: Never silence tests, never weaken lint rules, report unresolvable errors after 3 attempts.
```

### /refactor-clean (refactor-clean.md)

```markdown
Run a focused cleanup pass on the codebase. Delegates to the code-simplifier agent.

Cleans: dead code, duplication, complexity (>30 lines, >3 nesting levels), consistency.
Process: Focus on recent files first, one improvement at a time, test after every change.

Rules: Never change behavior, never combine with feature work, skip low-coverage files.
```

### /test-coverage (test-coverage.md)

```markdown
Analyze test coverage and fill gaps in critical areas. Delegates to the test-writer agent.

Process: Measure coverage, identify gaps in business logic and error paths,
prioritize by risk (HIGH: auth/validation, MEDIUM: business rules, LOW: getters),
write missing tests, report before/after coverage table.

Rules: Test behavior not implementation, no trivial tests, independent tests, report bugs don't fix.
```

- CLI self-update: `worclaude upgrade` checks npm registry, offers self-update with sudo detection
- Dynamic `--version` from package.json (was hardcoded)
- Smart version status in `worclaude status`: distinguishes workflow-outdated vs CLI-outdated vs up-to-date
- Shared `getLatestNpmVersion()` utility with 5s timeout for graceful offline degradation
- Numerous UX improvements and bug fixes (see PROGRESS.md for full list)

### Post-release (v1.3.0–v1.9.0)

- Delete command: safe workflow removal with hash-based file classification
- Agent enrichment: structured guidance, output formats, decision frameworks for all agent templates
- New agents: build-fixer, e2e-runner; new commands: build-fix, refactor-clean, test-coverage; new skill: security-checklist
- Session persistence: SessionStart hook auto-loads CLAUDE.md, PROGRESS.md, last session summary, and branch
- Drift detection: /start command detects commits since last session
- Doctor command: 4-category health check (core files, components, docs, integrity)
- Hook profiles: WORCLAUDE_HOOK_PROFILE environment variable (minimal/standard/strict)
- CI & branching strategy, Windows compatibility, comprehensive documentation

### v2.0.0: Claude Code Runtime Integration

- Skills migrated to directory format (`skill-name/SKILL.md`) — required by Claude Code's skill loader
- All 25 agent templates enriched with runtime frontmatter (`description`, `disallowedTools`, `background`, `maxTurns`, `omitClaudeMd`, `memory`)
- Skill and command templates enriched with `when_to_use`, `paths`, and `description` frontmatter
- Doctor: CLAUDE.md size check (WARN 30KB / FAIL 38KB), skill format check, agent description check
- Upgrade migrations: automatic skill flat→directory conversion, agent frontmatter auto-patching
- New content: MEMORY.md template, coordinator-mode skill, enhanced verify-app agent
- E2E audit with 60+ new tests for migration and doctor checks
- Documentation: new claude-code-integration.md guide + 13 reference/guide page updates

### v2.1.0: Post-release Polish and Backlog Implementation

- Agent frontmatter: added `criticalSystemReminder`, `skills`, `initialPrompt` fields to select agents
- Skill templates: added `version` field to all 11 universal skill frontmatter
- Doctor: agent frontmatter completeness scoring, CLAUDE.md section analysis
- Settings validation matrix: 46 tests covering all language/docker template combinations
- MEMORY.md template: enriched with structured content format (rule + Why + How to apply)
- Tech debt: removed dead code, deduplicated workflow validation, data-driven command registration

### v2.2.0: Native Memory, Richer Skills

- Removed project-root MEMORY.md scaffolding — Claude Code's native memory system at `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/` handles everything automatically
- Hooks reference: documented all 27 hook events (was 5) with matchers, exit codes, and use cases
- Hook types: documented all 4 types (command, prompt, http, agent) with per-type field tables
- Skill frontmatter: documented all 16 runtime fields (was 3) with applicability column
- Agent frontmatter: documented 6 new fields (tools, effort, color, permissionMode, mcpServers, hooks)
- CLAUDE.md @include directive and loading hierarchy documented
- Token budgets reference table added to context-management skill
- Coordinator mode: 4-phase workflow (Research → Synthesis → Implementation → Verification)
- Verify-app: added mobile, database migration, and data/ML pipeline verification patterns
- Documentation version examples updated from v1.1.0 to v2.2.0

## Design Decisions Reference

This spec is derived from tips by Boris Cherny (creator of Claude Code). Key design decisions:

1. **Agents are task-specific, not role-based.** No "backend-engineer" agents. Domain knowledge lives in skills.
2. **CLAUDE.md must be lean.** Under 50 lines. Progressive disclosure via skills.
3. **Sandbox with auto-allow** as default. Safety through structural isolation.
4. **High effort default.** Max escalated per session for complex tasks.
5. **Concise output style default.** Explanatory when exploring.
6. **Auto-naming for sessions.** Manual --name only when user wants it.
7. **Four hook events.** SessionStart context loading, format on write, PostCompact re-injection, notification on stop.
8. **All slash commands universal.** They're lightweight — include all 16 everywhere.
9. **Skills use progressive disclosure.** CLAUDE.md points to skills, skills load on demand.
10. **The pipeline: Design → Review → Execute → Quality → Verify → PR.**
11. **Hook profiles for flexibility.** Three levels (minimal/standard/strict) via environment variable — never break session context.
